A MATLAB implementation of Romber's method in numerical analysis to estimate the definite integral
## Romberg's Method
In numerical analysis, [**Romberg's method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romberg%27s_method) (Romberg 1955) is used to estimate the definite integral.
By applying [Richardson extrapolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation) (Richardson 1911) repeatedly on the [trapezium rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule) or the [rectangle rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum) (midpoint rule). The estimates generate a [triangular array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_array). Romberg's method is a [Newton–Cotes formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas) – it evaluates the integrand at equally spaced points. The integrand must have continuous derivatives, though fairly good results may be obtained if only a few derivatives exist. If it is possible to evaluate the integrand at unequally spaced points, then other methods such as [Gaussian quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature) and [Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clenshaw%E2%80%93Curtis_quadrature) are generally more accurate.
